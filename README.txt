This python 3.6 script is designed to answer the classic 'FizzBuzz' problem. 

Fizzbuzz(n) generates the first n Fibonacci numbers and prints:

"Buzz" when F(n) is divisible by 3.
"Fizz" when F(n) is divisible by 5.
"FizzBuzz" when F(n) is divisible by 15.
"BuzzFizz" when F(n) is prime.
the value F(n) otherwise.

and returns 'End of Sequence' after finishing printing everything in the sequence.
